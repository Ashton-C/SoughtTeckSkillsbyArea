# SoughtTeckSkillsbyArea
Heyo! The main idea behind this project was so that I could find out what the most
sought tech skills in an area were so that I could focus my time correctly so that I could
get a job in software development as quickly as possible. Basically, it's a web scraper.
It scrapes a few jobsites for a given location for software developer job titles and then
returns the amount of times it saw those across all the postings.

Note: This project is a personal project for me to help teach me to code.
